# coffee_machine
day 15 of python
#### This coffee machine prints the report of the resources used, we can choose 3 different coffees ranging from espresso, latte and then cappuccino.
#### There is a lovely ascii art in the beginning. 
#### Once we order a coffee, it asks us what amount in coins we want to enter, the coins starts from pennies: $0.01, nickels: $0.05, dimes: $0.10, to quarters: $0.25
#### Each coffee has a different amount, if we give more amount than the coffee then the balance is returned to us.
#### It then checks for the resources, resources are reduced everytime a different coffee is ordered, each coffee has different resources.
